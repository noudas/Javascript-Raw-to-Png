# CR2 to PNG Converter

This project uses Node.js to convert CR2 images to PNG format. It leverages the `cr2-raw` package to extract raw image data from CR2 files and then saves them as PNGs.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system.
- The `cr2-raw` package installed globally or locally within your project.

## Installation

If you haven't already installed the `cr2-raw` package, you can do so by running:


## Usage

1. Ensure you have the input folder (`inputFolder`) and output folder (`outputFolder`) correctly set up according to your file structure.
2. Run the script using Node.js:



Replace `index.js` with the name of your main script file if it's different.

## Configuration

The script currently expects the input and output folders to be hardcoded. To make it more flexible, consider adding command-line arguments or environment variables for specifying these paths.
